# Psychic-Game
I created a game where the user guesses a letter with 10 available tries. If the user guesses correctly using one of those tries, the user wins and the game is reset. The game is also reset when the number of guesses reaches 0. A log of keys tried is set at the bttom of the screen.
Overall, making this game allowed me to put my knowledge of javascript into action while pushing me to discover what javascript can do by manipulating variables.
